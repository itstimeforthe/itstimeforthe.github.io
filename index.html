Censorship in Nazi Germany was extreme and strictly enforced by the governing Nazi Party, 
but specifically by Joseph Goebbels and his Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda.
The same body also produced and disseminated their own literature which were solely devoted to furthering Nazi ideas and myths.
Anti-semitism lay at the core of their works, and included films such as Jud Süß (1940 film) and The Eternal Jew (1940 film). 
The ministry promoted the cult of Adolf Hitler by sponsoring early films such as Triumph of the Will of the 1934 rally and The Victory of
Faith made in 1933, and which survives now as a single copy recently discovered in the UK. It was banned by the Nazis owing to the
prominent role of Ernst Roehm, who was murdered by Hitler on the Night of the Long Knives in 1934.
The ministry tightly controlled information available to their citizens. Almost all Modernist art, such as Impressionism and 
Expressionism, was considered degenerate art by the Nazi regime, and much modern music such as Jazz and Swing was also barred 
as degenerate music. Jewish composers like Mendelsohn and Schoenberg were also banned. Amongst those authors and artists who were
suppressed both during the Nazi book burnings and the attempt to destroy modernist fine art in the "degenerate" art exhibition were:

<p>Ernest Hemingway,</p>
<p>Bertolt Brecht,</p>
<p>Thomas Mann,</p>
<p>John Dos Passos,</p>
<p>H. G. Wells</p>
<p></p>
<p>Artists such as</p>
<p></p>
<p>Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler</p>
<p>Pablo Picasso</p>
<p>Claude Monet</p>
<p>Vincent van Gogh</p>

<p>Composers such as</p>

<p>Gustav Mahler</p>
<p id="getin">Edward Smites</p>
<p>Felix Mendelsohn</p>
<p>Arnold Schoenberg</p>

<p>Philosophers, scientists and sociologists were suppressed by the Nazi Germany:</p>

<p>Albert Einstein,</p>
<p>Niels Bohr,</p>
<p>Edmund Husserl,</p>
<p>Karl Marx,</p>
<p>Friedrich Engels,</p>
<p>Friedrich Nietzsche,</p>
<p>Sigmund Freud,</p>
<p>Max Scheler</p>
